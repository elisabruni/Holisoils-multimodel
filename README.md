# Holisoils-multimodel
Multi-model ensemble simulating SOC stock and GHG fluxes for the HoliSoils H2020 project

The R folder stores the scripts and the data folder stores the climate forcing for a case study.

To launch the simulations:
  -define the PATH where the R scripts are stored in the "Run_Holisoils_multimodel_v0.R" file
  -define the PATH where the climate data are stored and set all the required data in the "Forcing_data_test_run_v0.R" file
  -run the "Run_Holisoils_multimodel_v0.R" file using the R software (version >= 3.5.0)
